# Work Orders

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1 as part of the Front-end developer assessment for [Hatchways](https://www.hatchways.io/) in 2020.

The purpose of this project is to categorize the data received from an API and visualize the results using an interactive single page application.

For a detailed guide on how to complete the assessment on your own, please refer to the [Instructions](docs/front-end-assessment-work-orders.pdf)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
